# Arte Útil Scraper

## About the Project

This software scrapes the [Arte Útil archive](https://www.arte-util.org/projects/).

Arte Útil is a project that has inspired Radical Data's work, showing the possibilities of art as a tool within society. As the website hosting the archive has a limited number of possible interactions, we wanted an easier way to explore the projects in the archive.

We built this scraper to collect all of the projects' data into a spreadsheet and download all of the images.

## Getting Started

1. Install Python
1. Install `pandas` and `lxml`
2. Navigate to this folder: `cd ./arte-util-scraper`
3. Run `python scrape-archive.py`

## Other thoughts

Though I'm sure we would have done it anyway, Arte Útil encourages people to create alternative presentations of the Archive.

> Users are invited to download, print and build their own archive.
